Hi
This text represents raw string input that obviously does not fit into a single line of Minecraft Book. But with the help of the python script this text can be formatted in a way to fit. The script will split text into lines and pages keeping the paragraphs and spaces untouched. 
Let's make these sentences a new paragraph.
       …and this paragraph starts with some spaces. 
The text arrangement logic supports §9default§r §oMinecraft§r §n§cformatting§r attributes, beside the BOLD tag. But all of them will stay in the output text.
With the help of extra tags you can apply specific styling and arrangement to specific parts of the text. For example: {{$new_page}} This text will always start with a new page.
{{$new_page}}The script output can be founded in §adebug§r folder
